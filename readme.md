## Car Accident Detection Model based on LSTM and CNN

In this project, we tended to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to find the probability of an incident or accident occurring between the short time period datasets. We try to build three architecture models with various activation functions and then compare each result of them giving the highest accuracy.

**It should be noted that the datasets are not provided here due to the company agreement and privacy reasons.**
